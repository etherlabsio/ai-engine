So one were trying to make it easier to listen to music. So if you think about kind of the original store of certified what's very much a self type with platform where you would come and basically have to create your own playlist hand them one by one adding a track et cetera and uses thousand amazing service. They were really happy about that. But at the same time we're kind of shutting out a lot of people don't have the time the end or the skills to be creating a lot of playlist for themselves. So what we're trying to do to change experience. So you don't have to do all that hard. You can come to qualify can get great playlist great sessions great stuff without having to do all of that hard work yourself the second thing we're trying to do is to help you discover and help you find new things so think about it as you have the use being on a journey with and on that journey you get to find a new I think things that you wouldn't have found other ways. So the idea here is that when you've been on the service for safety months you wake up on morning and you realize that all of a sudden you found this new artists the new founder from new things that you didn't know before that are now thirteen your last and the third thing we're trying to do is also help at and help artists. So how can we help them become the best version of themselves. How can we help them find the audience that they deserve. So you might be in Mexico and you're doing all these great stuff but how can you find a fans perhaps you know south and deeply in connecting the thousand some people in Thailand Et cetera cetera.","confidence":0.9756769,"startTime":"2019-05-29T07:05:19Z","endTime":"2019-05-29T07:07:19Z","duration":120,"recordingId":"ad0d31212537456abe20949b39a00a3f","spokenBy":"36df6402-c7d8-40a2-86aa-6df2fd8cf555","languageCode":"en-US","transcriber":"deepgram","status":"completed","transcriptId":"482414db-7047-4250-972d-70607e65b3e8","createdAt":"2019-05-29T07:07:20.875773636Z","updatedAt":"2019-05-29T07:07:24.868238815Z","deletedAt":null,"deleted":false}
