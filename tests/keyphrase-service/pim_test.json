You describe the configuration of your application and a yeah mol file this Eurasian file is where you tell kubernetes how to do things like gather container images how to establish networking between containers how to mount storage volumes in order to store logs for that container containers are deployed on Two Hosts usually in replicated groups and when it's time to deploy a new container into a cluster kubernetes schedules the deployment and looks from the most appropriate host to place the container based on predefined constraints of your choosing like CPU or memory availability, basically once the Tina is running on the host kubernetes manages its life cycle according to the specifications. You laid out in the containers Docker file, which means the kubernetes is automating all of these tasks for you, but it does so based on the configuration you set up as the developer and while you may be a crack shot engineer chances are you don't know exactly how much traffic you're going to get within the first month of live deployment or how your application will behave that's why I specially for those first couple of months modern. During your kubernetes cluster is super important. ",
