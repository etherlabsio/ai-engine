To Franklin do a test for it. Yeah, go like call but we can't test this stuff app staging to that is I don't. I can release a build for it. So once I like I'll do like once I get sometime time I'll set up the commands to build file for to. Yeah because like you attach a recorder test say and yeah i. So what kind was thinking that I like instead of posting pushing directly to I'll just make a local then give it to to then after E s test stated then I'll push it. Yeah yeah that you can like two staging to build for then I got it one. I was working on Desktop of sharing screen sharing so the next stop pal like for the next it's working fine now but the changes I had made in the background for the has started the current or that browser meet. So today I'll work on the that of our browser because I had to change the version so electron so I'll work on that to the and then I'll pick the device selection like or for the call if it is not said in the if let's say has not handling if when we have sent it a configuration or options. We have to explicitly set those devices that's pretty small. So first I'll completely complete this task and then I'll pick them. What is it because I thought with that started and what is issue there guys is right. There can be the device Id D we we are sending it to account configuration okay, but sometimes you say rights server options and takes voice okay itself. So once the API call the how we have down display my Java files the same thing we have to make it for the video or not the device selection. ",
