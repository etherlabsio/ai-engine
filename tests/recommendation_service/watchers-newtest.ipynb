Here what we can do is we can create a meeting and start the meeting which will automatically trigger other other things which will start to spin up a new machine like start the recording the recording land you can see we can be consumed each week, which is a provider and you can you can do that play video and other things.And once the video is played, you know end up meeting that sit up there. And again the post-meeting prevention is this just for POS if you will if you want we can redesign also but this for to get this with the initial thing, this is what I'm saying, like we create a new provider as a recorded area something and then we add additives in the URL.And we shot the meeting and will from the from the client when the client is already done like with the videos when we win The veto stop playing all you need to do is end the meeting and the and it will come back to the slack. You don't have to do anything specific for that if you think that once this is done and we have good support to show while recording happen so we can support everything we have the Washings also.So from the for the Postcard video right in the watch has links with the Marine those things will also work.Okay.\",\n",

So I created the Mi which has the changes which boots up the which starts degree of 0 0 for Alpha and rattle right. Now. I have done this very simplistic ec2 instance which is which is on a public subnet and it has a root GPS device and also as part of any restart or any termination I have just said the GPS device like delete on termination set to false. So what I faced issue was like for example, if I change the subnet from public to private or private to public terraform wish to terminate the voltage sensor and it creates a new instance. So with that even the GPS devices which with their whatever root device Map that also destroys and recreates so that is not intended behavior for a so what I have done is I have set the delete on termination as false. So the data EBS volume is not will not be deleted as part of easy to termination. Now. What I have to figure out is like if like, how do we ReStore in these type of cases where we terminate and restart lecture Corner case? So in case of termination and restart, I need to find a way to restore from the old volume volume snapshot. So that is something which I have. Figure out but that will not be blocked for session car to progress on the knowledge graph. So we can continue on that. So today I am planning to send out the pr and I'll also send the details to Xiang to start using the new instance, which is in. \",\n",

So now I'm going to use just our engineering Channel and Emily a channel user keywords to to test the recommendation. So previously before before this I tested it wandered Watchers on using staging to dance so I I was testing It on stage in two hours or so. But the data was cute, so I was not able to give any conclusive results then so right now the idea is with our engineering Channel and Emily a channel. We have a good number of keywords representing each of the users. For example, like for user session related words, like key phrases and graph and towards things for others. There are a language model. So hopefully it so if we're going by the last class times Bowman goes with wanted watches the similarity search and comparison is working fine. So if that if that is actually working fine, then we should be able to see good recommended watches based on today's test. \",\n",

I think we have we've been we've been seeing the testing and then checking on the results on on the calls that we make and also on the test calls one observation is that as I mentioned earlier it is it needs lot of it needs a consistent language unlike other other Downstream tasks so it can go you can go little off track with the Indian accent.

So these things so what I'm trying to do with the connect all these things together and then form a new kind of slicing method which can or cannot use communities. So for that we already have something called as ether graph which when card has been working on which consists of all the entities and key phrases from both our training data on the meeting conversations. So we take that information into these key phrases and everything and we bring it to meeting long context so meeting the whole meeting right now and it happens it would have a separate curve which would be again on the meeting level. What are the informations which we can get speakers sentences. And the extract entities key phrases and anything and we try to marry this meeting graph with the epigraph. So this is still in an early stage. It might take one more week to week 4 and full of it. But right now the right few methods few approaches, which we are encouraging this also a very increasing so we should have some good approach by the end of next week. \",\n",

I mean it wouldn't be so off but still parallely. We are also discussing on how to how to take more control of the communities instead of relying on this, you know sensitive instead of making making it more or less sensitive. Actually So currently it's very sensitive to any any Community formation and other aspects so at a high level like a posted in the engineering Channel We are looking at ways to take take more control of the graph formation. And they and also the body called the Dead the relationship formation the graph Community formation. So it needs some experimentation. We are we are discussing on that and also parallel. We are what you call experimenting so we should have when we will keep you posted on this. But as of this is this what it is we have we have to address some of the The problems with the community formation for the wherein you know hierarchies are not really a currently hierarchies are not in our control. So it's like a blanket hierarchy for Direction. So we have to take control of that. That means we should be fuzzy about it. We shouldn't be doing like a blanket formation so which which is the problem that we have. I mean currently solving a tap from a more technical standpoint. \",\n",

And they and also the body called the Dead the relationship formation the graph Community formation. So it needs some experimentation. We are we are discussing on that and also parallel. We are what you call experimenting so we should have when we will keep you posted on this. But as of this is this what it is we have we have to address some of the The problems with the community formation for the wherein you know hierarchies are not really a currently hierarchies are not in our control. So it's like a blanket hierarchy for Direction. So we have to take control of that. That means we should be fuzzy about it.

I I have built couple of call graphs or or the you know vocabulary is one is like a named ent*ty detail list which is which has like all the name ent*ties and try to feature and and you you know the context in mean they have come to send that means that's if features for stream. Then would be the aggregate feature after all all the sentences in which it. It has occurred okay right? So I'm then trying to play around with that I'll once I that's one part and and the now one that I was talking in the morning came I took call and on phrases and then and then this some did some group recognition without doing it without doing any value filters test and then created that list of like thousand plus nouns but which chicken can if you don't have anything else you can use that person setting out the key phrases. So if you if you use any all of the you you you can check which on works for you.\",\n",

So let's try to play around as much as far like you the and time we'll do need with feature. Yes. So if if there is an auto ent*ty ticket instead of trying to say that it's not now what I'm trying to do it. I'm taking it context and then compare and we to okay I find the closest this like current and feature to it close enough. It's more less the same by different.

Oh okay. So so the so these so these things were there which they've based it on the grammar rules and they so when I was just checking it out one good thing thing one better thing that would be done is you like somewhat using code reference or something we will find like what we keep going back into that segment and check it's person it is referring to or even if there's no person's information because our conversation is about all U I and all those things yeah yeah. So then we take the speaker information from the segment ID and then when they put it there and change this and constructive. So yeah. So it will be like only to deploy g g G p two.\",\n",

So if AWS and Google cloud and all those things should come under a higher bracket called cloud or some some kind of tag like so that so that node which is called cloud administration that will have a very high between score right?

I mean essentially it's still doing what it's supposed to do which is grouping a bunch of text segments based on certain criteria and that criteria can be different algorithm limitations and I can just specify which L go to use.

       "\"Yeah, so the last night I was like finally I was able to populate the entire production data 2D graph. So now I'm going to use just our engineering Channel and Emily a channel user keywords to to test the recommendation. So previously before before this I tested it wandered Watchers on using staging to dance so I I was testing It on stage in two hours or so. But the data was cute, so I was not able to give any conclusive results then so right now the idea is with our engineering Channel and Emily a channel. We have a good number of keywords representing each of the users. For example, like for user session related words, like key phrases and graph and towards things for others. There are a language model. So hopefully it so if we're going by the last class times Bowman goes with wanted watches the similarity search and comparison is working fine. So if that if that is actually working fine, then we should be able to see good recommended watches based on today's test. \""

       "\"Yeah, so the last night I was like finally I was able to populate the entire production data 2D graph. So now I'm going to use just our engineering Channel and Emily a channel user keywords to to test the recommendation. So previously before before this I tested it wandered Watchers on using staging to dance so I I was testing It on stage in two hours or so. But the data was cute, so I was not able to give any conclusive results then so right now the idea is with our engineering Channel and Emily a channel. We have a good number of keywords representing each of the users. For example, like for user session related words, like key phrases and graph and towards things for others. There are a language model. So hopefully it so if we're going by the last class times Bowman goes with wanted watches the similarity search and comparison is working fine. So if that if that is actually working fine, then we should be able to see good recommended watches based on today's test. \""
