I wouldn't call them technically like super smart. Okay, like what courses you take? You know, what siding problem on the coding but has them about computer science Concepts as important projects that is built. So he did he like is edible from football score predicts, you know, like very academic right? I tried this distribution that is tuition, but didn't really understand why that any of them would work. But it basically at least try to do something called address the college process great like cosmetic dentist. Will then ask them as I am to see like if you understood some Concepts. Buzzer about multi-threading operating systems real-time operating system versus non real-time memory management. Will you do my luck in your court? So then he said she said operating system is as in what operating system will you use if you're going to build a pacemaker? He said, oh, I'll give you the real tompa plz operating system or is the difference between that and this so we're a bunch of things and all of them. Like he really couldn't like you there's nothing that he said that was impressive. Okay here is really high level. But for example, if you don't love that for a six part right here is what I would consider like really really. ",

If I ask them then they knew the answer be either that or the coding problems as soon as you ask the question they did is they come with the summation. So we need to look for either one of them not only for example for a computer science student. I wouldn't say he is he can understand the concept very very high very high level. I would have to be more precise right like as like a zoom scheduler, right? So let's say forget about so you could answer a lot of these memory management question. Let's say the pacemaker my heart rate went below some number and I wanted one process to run it has to run because yeah, right right. It's like. Life and death. What what is the difference between running a process in real time versus non real-time system simple have expected him to say okay here if you put a priority we get a rarity and if I property will be something more very very kind of precise like that. Right? So I didn't I wasn't, you know, what a priority means for the thread or process so he didn't know that so then they're then I miss that person can have I started to feel real thing. That maybe is also not academically, you know, very strong.Yeah, what do you mean? I definitely support engineer. You don't waste it because is communication is very clear. It's very well. His demeanor is very good. So for culture fit, he'll be okay. I don't think that there will be a problem. He wants or first off. We don't want to work for the company of the one.",
